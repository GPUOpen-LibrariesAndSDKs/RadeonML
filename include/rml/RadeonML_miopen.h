/**
 * MIOpen can run in 2 different ways.
 * It can either search for the best convolution algorithm for a given problem size
 * or avoid that search.
 * This mechanism is called auto tuning.
 * By default it is off as it is a costly operation. But an application may want to use for
 * performance reason
 * https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen/blob/master/doc/src/perfdatabase.md#auto-tuning-the-kernels
 *
 * @param[in] context A valid context handle.
 * @param[in] on      A boolean indicating if the auto tuning state for MIOpen convolution is on.
 *
 * @return Status:
 * - #RML_OK if the operation is successful,
 * - #RML_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETER if @p context is invalid.
 *
 * To get more details in case of failure, call rmlGetLastError().
